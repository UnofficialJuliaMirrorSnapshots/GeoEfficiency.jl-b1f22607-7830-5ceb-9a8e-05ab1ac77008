# GeoEfficiency: Accurate Geometrical Efficiency Calculator


An officially registered Julia program that provides a set of tools to calculate the geometrical efficiency in a fast and accurate way.  The Package models a radiation detector irradiated by a radioactive source.  The Package relay directly on numerical evaluation of closed form analytical formula describing the geometrical efficiency.

## Download/Installation


Getting the GeoEfficiency package to work involves two steps: 


<a id='.-Installing-Julia-Language-1'></a>

### 1. Installing Julia Language


Just head over to the Julia language [download page](https://www.julialang.org/downloads/) and choose the suitable binary for your platform to download and install.  At the end of this step you should be able to run julia from your system. 


!!! note "JuliaBox.com"
    Head to [JuliaBox.com](https://www.juliabox.com) to run julia in your browser without any local installation. no registration is required just a Google account.



<a id='.-Installing-Package-1'></a>

### 2. Installing Package


GeoEfficiency is registered officially and so the latest stable release can be installed through the Julia package management system just by typing the following into the julia REPL prompt.


```julia
julia> import Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("GeoEfficiency") 
```


<a id='Quick-Usage-1'></a>

## Quick Usage


After installing the package, you can load it to your current workspace by typing the following:


```julia
julia> using GeoEfficiency
```


Now the package is available to use, try typing:


```julia
julia> calc()
```


**see also: [`geoEff()`](manual\Calculations.md#GeoEfficiency.geoEff), [`calcN()`](manual\Output_Interface.md#GeoEfficiency.calcN), [`batch()`](manual\Output_Interface.md#GeoEfficiency.batch)**


<a id='Unit-Test-1'></a>

## Unit Test


For scientific calculation accuracy in calculation and being error free is a highly demanded objective. Thus, the package is extensively tested method-wise in each supported operating system. Operating system fully supported include Windows, Linus, Apple OSX.


After installing the package can be tested in your own system by typing the following into the REPL prompt.


```julia
julia> using Test, Pkg
julia> Pkg.test("GeoEfficiency") 
```


<a id='Package-Overview-1'></a>

## Package Overview


The following constructor can be used to construct a specific type of detector 


  * [`CylDetector`](manual\Physics_Model.md#GeoEfficiency.CylDetector) for cylindrical detector,
  * [`BoreDetector`](manual\Physics_Model.md#GeoEfficiency.BoreDetector) for bore hole,
  * [`WellDetector`](manual\Physics_Model.md#GeoEfficiency.WellDetector) for well type detector.


While the function [`Detector`](manual\Development.md#GeoEfficiency.Detector) can be used to construct any of the above types. You may try also [`getDetectors`](manual\Development.md#GeoEfficiency.getDetectors).


[`Point`](manual\Physics_Model.md#GeoEfficiency.Point) constructor is used to construct an anchoring point of a source. relative to source anchoring point the source position is specified. For a point source, the anchoring point is the source itself.  The [`source()`](manual\Physics_Model.md#GeoEfficiency.source) method take input from the 'console' and return a tuple describing the source.


The efficiency calculation can be done by one of the functions: 


  * [`geoEff`](manual\Calculations.md#GeoEfficiency.geoEff) used with or without argument(s),
  * [`calc`](manual\Output_Interface.md#GeoEfficiency.calc) ask for the required information from the 'console',
  * [`calcN`](manual\Output_Interface.md#GeoEfficiency.calcN) just a repeat of the [`calc`](manual\Output_Interface.md#GeoEfficiency.calc) function
  * [`batch()`](manual\Output_Interface.md#GeoEfficiency.batch) which try to take required information from csv files located in   the home directory inside a folder called `GeoEfficiency`.


For more on the function and its methods prefix the name of the function by `?`.


!!! note
    Input from the 'console' can be numerical expression not just a number. `5/2` ; `5//2` ; `pi` ; `Ï€/2` ; `exp(2)` ; `1E-2` ; `5.2/3` ; `sin(1)` ;  `sin(1)^2` are all valid expressions.



<a id='Batch-Calculation-1'></a>

## Batch Calculation


The package can be used to perform batch calculations by calling one of the  methods of the function `batch`. The output results of batch calculations is  found by default in `GeoEfficiency\results` folder inside the user home directory.


**For example  `c:\users\yourusername\GeoEfficiency\results\`**.


The function [`batch()`](manual\Output_Interface.md#GeoEfficiency.batch) can be called with or without arrangement(s).  The without argument version relay on previously prepared Comma Saved  Values  [CSV] files, that can be easily edit by Microsoft Excel, located by default  in the `GeoEfficiency` folder.


Those Comma Saved Values [CSV] files are:-


  * `Detectors.csv` contains the detectors description (`a detector per line`); The line format is: 

    ```
      Crystal_Radius | Crystal_Length | Hole_Radius | Hole_Depth |
      ---------------| ---------------|-------------|----------- |
    ```


  * `srcHeights.csv` contains the source heights; 

    ```
      Source_Heights | 
      ---------------|
    ```


  * `srcRhos.csv` contains the source off-axis distances;                        

    ```
      Source_Rhos | 
      ------------|
    ```


  * `srcRadii.csv` contains the source radii for disc and cylindrical sources;             

    ```
      Source_Radii| 
      ------------|
    ```


  * `srcLengths.csv` contains the source length for cylindrical sources;    

    ```
      Source_Lengths| 
      --------------|
    ```


!!! note
    For Comma Saved Values [CSV] files each line represent an entry, the first line is always treated as the header.



!!! warning
    The program expect each line to contain one number for all CSV files except for `Detectors.csv` each line should contain at least one number or at most four separated numbers

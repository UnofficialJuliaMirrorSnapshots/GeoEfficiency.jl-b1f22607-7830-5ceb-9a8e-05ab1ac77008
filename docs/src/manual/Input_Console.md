# Console Input
Julia language is quite reach langauge but it seems a good idea thought to collect repeated tasks involing input from console in compact and coustumized to the need function.
this section provid two essential functions to deal with inputs from the console. the first:

```
GeoEfficiency.input
```

while the secand is a more complex function:

```
GeoEfficiency.getfloat
```

Those function are not exported that is normally the user will not need to use them but they are documented here to allow a develober ranked user to make use of them.

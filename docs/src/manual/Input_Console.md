# Console Input
Julia language is quite reach language but it seems a good idea thought to collect repeated tasks involving input from console in compact and customized to the need function.
this section provide two essential functions to deal with inputs from the console. the first:

```
GeoEfficiency.input
```

while the second is a more complex function:

```
GeoEfficiency.getfloat
```

Those function are not exported that is normally the user will not need to use them but they are documented here to allow a developer ranked user to make use of them.

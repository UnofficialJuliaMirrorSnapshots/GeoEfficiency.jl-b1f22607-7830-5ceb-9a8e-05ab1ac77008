# Configuration

found in the source file `Config.jl`

parameter | describtion| default value
:----------|:------------|:--------------:
dataFolder | name of the root directory | "GeoEfficiency"
dataDir    |  root directory            | joinpath(homedir(), dataFolder)
integrate  |  use the package `QuadGK` to perform integration | begin using QuadGK; QuadGK.quadgk; end
relativeError |                         | 1.0E-4  
absoluteError |                         | eps(1.0)
resultsFolder | name of the result directory inside the root directory | "results"  
max_display   | define the default for maximum number of entries shown in the `console` in batch mode | 20 **see [`max_batch`](@ref)**

# Error System

```@docs
GeoEfficiency.GeoException

GeoEfficiency.InValidDetectorDim
```

```@docs
GeoEfficiency.@validateDetector

```@docs
GeoEfficiency.NotImplementedError

# Console Input
Julia language is quite reach langauge but it seems a good idea thought to collect repeated tasks involing input from console in compact and coustumized to the need function.
this section provid two essential functions to deal with inputs from the console. the first:

```@docs
GeoEfficiency.input
```

while the secand is a more complex function:

```@docs
GeoEfficiency.getfloat
```

Those function are not exported that is normally the user will not need to use them but they are documented here to allow a develober ranked user to make use of them.

# Physics Model

Two abstract detector types defined in the package to classify the detectors, the top most super type,

```@docs
GeoEfficiency.RadiationDetector
```

any future detector defination should inhert from `RadiationDetector`. The secand abstract detector   `Detector` is also a sub-type of `RadiationDetector` but it only acomodates cylinderical type only.

```@docs
GeoEfficiency.Detector
```

can be used to constract leaf detector.

```@docs
Detector()
```

also it can be used to construct a concrete detector depend on the provided arguments.

```@docs
Detector(CryRadius::Real, CryLength::Real, HoleRadius::Real, HoleDepth::Real)
```

```@docs
Detector(CryRadius::Real)
```

```@docs
Detector(CryRadius::Real, CryLength::Real)
```

```@docs
Detector(CryRadius::Real, CryLength::Real, HoleRadius::Real)
```
